First serious attempt to create a database oriented application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created using SceneBuilder, SQLite DataBase and Java.

In addition the design and methods overviews have been added. 

My goal here is to learn the basics when it comes to coding in Java as well as connecting that with a simple database.

Additionally the process of talking to "a client" let me design the application piece by piece and document how it was evolving over time.

Still work in progress*
